================================
<img src="images/schickler.jpg">

I have been at Oregon State University since 2008, when I was initially hired at the Radiation Center to be a Nuclear Reactor Operator.  I am now a Reactor Engineer (and NRC-licensed Senior Reactor Operator); my main duties involve performing various analyses on our 1 MW TRIGA research reactor.  I obtained my master's degree in Nuclear Engineering in the fall of 2012 and am currently in my 2nd year as a Nuclear Engineering PhD student.  My advisor is Dr. Todd Palmer.
