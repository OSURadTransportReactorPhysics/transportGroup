I am a first year graduate student at Oregon State University under Dr. Todd Palmer. I have not settled on a specific research topic yet.

I got my BS in Mechanical Engineering and a minor in Nuclear Engineering from Kennesaw State University in 2022. Hooty Hoo!

## A few of my favorite things
* Cycling (primarily on the road and with climbs and descents)
* Chess (my favorite chess player of all time is Raul Capablanca)
* Watching sports (soccer, cycling, and college football)
