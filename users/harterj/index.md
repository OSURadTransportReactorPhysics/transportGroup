Jackson Harter graduated from Oregon State University in 2015 with a Master's in Nuclear Engineering and in 2019 with a Ph.D. in Nuclear Engineering.
His Master's thesis is titled [*Predicting Thermal Conductivity in Nuclear Fuels using Rattlesnake-Based Deterministic Phonon Transport Simulations*](https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/concern/graduate_thesis_or_dissertations/mw22v804z?locale=en) and his Ph.D. dissertation is titled [*Advanced Deterministic Phonon Transport Techniques for Predicting Spectral Thermal Conductivity in Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Media*](https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/concern/graduate_thesis_or_dissertations/xg94hw655?locale=en). Since leaving Oregon State University, Jackson is now a staff-scientist at Idaho National Laboratory.
