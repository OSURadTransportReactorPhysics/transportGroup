Particle System
=========

This is a particle system developed Spring 2015. I was motivated to create this after taking CS 575 - Introduction to Parallel Programming, by Dr. Mike Bailey. This program utilizes GPUs to calculate many particles' positions and velocities relative to a large massive object (planet). The particles begin in an "explosion" of random starting directions and velocities and eventually settle into several rings of orbits.

The video can be viewed  [here](https://github.com/rtrp/osu-transport/blob/gh-pages/users/woodsdou/ParticleSystem/planet480p.mov?raw=true).
