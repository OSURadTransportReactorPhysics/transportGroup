See an error you need to fix? 

1. On your local copy, fix the error in the offending .tex file, then compile a new-and-improved PDF.

2. Add the new .tex and .pdf files and commit them. Easy as pie!

3. Pat yourself on the back, you've done RTRP and the transport community a service. 

4. Curse me, Aaron James Reynolds, for making the error in the first place.

5. Seriously, thank you.
