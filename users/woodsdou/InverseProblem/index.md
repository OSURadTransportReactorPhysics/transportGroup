Inverse Transport/Diffusion Problem
===========

In our [presentation]((https://github.com/rtrp/osu-transport/blob/gh-pages/users/woodsdou/InverseProblem/Project.pdf?raw=true)), we utilized the Levenberg-Marquardt method to solve an unconstrained optimization problem. Based on the transport solution to the Reed problem, we calculated the diffusion coefficient for each material region necessary to achieve the diffusion solution in each region.
