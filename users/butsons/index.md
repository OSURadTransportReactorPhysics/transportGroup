I am a first year graduate student at Oregon State University under Dr. Todd Palmer. My research interests are still undecided, but I am currently exploring applying reduced order modeling techniques to thermal radiation problems. 

A high school internship at the Reed College Nuclear Reactor sparked my interest in nuclear engineering. I hope to pursue a career contributing to the expansion of nuclear energy as a viable clean power source.

I received a BASc in Mechanical Engineering (Mechantronics Option) with a minor in Physics from the University of British Columbia in 2023. 

## Extracuricular Interests
Bouldering, hiking, lifting, parkour, playing guitar, reading.
