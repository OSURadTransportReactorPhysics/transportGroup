I am a first-year graduate student under Dr. Todd Palmer at Oregon State University, where I just graduated with my BS in Nuclear Engineering and minors in Chemistry and Economics. During my undergrad I interned at NuScale Power in the Core and Fuels group working on reactivity transient analysis. The summer before graduate school I researched spent nuclear fuel disposal for the American Nuclear Society through the Washington Internship for Students of Engineering (WISE) program.

My extracurricular interests include hiking, cooking, music, college sports, and video games
