I am a first year graduate student at Oregon State University under Dr. Todd Palmer. My research interests are still undecided, but I am currently exploring applying reduced order modeling techniques to thermal radiation problems. 

I received a BASc in Mechanical Engineering (Mechantronics Option) with a minor in Physics from the University of British Columbia in 2023.  

## Extracuricular Interests
Bouldering, hiking, parkour, playing guitar, reading, weight lifting.
