I am a graduate student working in the Radiation Transport and Reactor Physics group at Oregon State University.
I focus on modeling isotope production in research reactors and diversity, equity, and inclusion in STEM fields. Dr. Todd S. Palmer is my advisor.

I graduated with a BS in Nuclear and Radiological Engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 2007 and my MS in Nuclear Engineering in 2009.

## Research Interests

My current work is in modeling Plutonium-238 production for use in NASA radioisotope power systems. Currently, Np-237 targets are being irradiated at Oak Ridge National Laboratory's High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) to produce Pu-238. However, HFIR cannot produce the quantities needed to support NASA mission requirements. Thus the capacity of Idaho National Laboratory's Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) is being evaluated.

In order to facilitate this analysis, reduced order modeling methods are being developed to avoid the necessity of running a full Monte Carlo model for each target position and design. 

I also work on diversity and inclusion in nuclear engineering and STEM fields in general, both through research and participation in the Diversity and Inclusion in the American Nuclear Society committee.

## Other Interests

I do historic recreation with the Society for Creative Anachronism, where I do calligraphy, simple garb construction, and volunteer for the service side of things through my position as treasurer, running events, and helping with events I'm not running.

I also play clarinet and dabble in playing the hammered dulcimer.
