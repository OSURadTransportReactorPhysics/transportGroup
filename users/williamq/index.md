I'm a second year M.S. student at Oregon State University interested in machine learning applications for neutronic problems and reactor simulation. My current research involves the development of mathematical surrogate models of Idaho State's AGN-201 research reactor for use in Idaho National Lab's digital twin effort. I graduated from Oregon State with my B.S. in nuclear engineering spring of 2022.
