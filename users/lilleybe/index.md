I'm a PhD candidate at Oregon State. I grew up in Oregon, but studied mechanical engineering and physics for my undergraduate degrees in other states (WA and MO). I've also spent time in the New England area and in North Carolina. You can reach me at <a href="mailto:lilleybe@oregonstate.edu" target="top"> lilleybe@oregonstate.edu</a>.

## Research
My MS research involved using the fast reactor cross section code MC**2 and the neutron transport codes MCNP and Attila. My work focused on the evaluation of an experimental sodium-cooled loop for materials testing in the large-I position of the Advanced Test Reactor.

My PhD research is focused on the optimization of fuel sharing for a NuScale-like power plant. I use CASMO to generate a lattice library. These lattices can be assembled randomly or with a Dakota optimization tool (e.g., genetic algorithm) into a full core. These cores are evaluated with the SIMULATE neutron diffusion code, and grouped according to how they meet safety limits and cost effectiveness, allowing the core designer to choose among the best designs. Fuel sharing between cores is a new dimension to the design problem that promises further cost savings.

## Personal interests
I'm fundamentally concerned about climate change and its effect on human health and biodiversity. That's why I'm studying nuclear engineering. I also bike instead of drive (even <a href="https://www.crazyguyonabike.com/bclilley" target="blank">cross-country</a>). Additionally, I've done some <a href="https://somethingaboutenergy.wordpress.com/" target="blank">blogging</a> about energy issues. My latest side project includes bringing nuclear engineering to kids at the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI).
