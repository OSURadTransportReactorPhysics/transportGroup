# Guides #

This page is an index of the growing set of guides behind the operations of the research group. It is intended to be a living document capturing the overviews and checklists for mastering the practical, administrative, and computational infrastructure that RTRP relies on for various common tasks. All research group members should contribute to this section early and often. If possible, link to GitHub repositories, gists, or Jupyter notebooks when there is a guide item that can be captured in one.

## Getting Started

Youâ€™re new to the research group. There are a lot of tasks to get done before you can really fly.

* Create a GitHub account.
* [Install](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and configure git.
* Follow [these](./wiki/start_my_page.md) instructions to add yourself to the RTRP website. 
* If you'd like a desk in the Merryfield graduate student office, work with TP to get access added to your OSU ID.
* Activate your OSU and COE computer accounts, and begin using your official OSU email address.
* [Request licenses](https://rsicc.ornl.gov/) for export controlled software. (Ask TP if any are needed for your project.)
* Read the [Code of Conduct](./codeofconduct.md) and [Expectations](./expectations.md).
* Download Katy Huff's book, [Effective Computation in Physics](http://lilith.fisica.ufmg.br/~dickman/transfers/comp/textos/Effective%20Computation%20in%20Physics%20(Python).pdf). Browse it now and use it as a reference when you are lost.
* Install a text editor of your choosing. (e.g. vim, emacs, atom, or xo).
* The [university library](https://library.oregonstate.edu/) allows you to checkout textbooks and view journal articles. They also have many workshops and guides, including [this general research guide](https://guides.library.oregonstate.edu/nuclearengineering) specifically for OSU's Nuclear Engineering programs.
Register for classes.
* Additional resources:
  * The NSE Graduate Student Handbook for your matriculation year
  * [The School of Nuclear Science and Engineering's Graduate Advising page](https://engineering.oregonstate.edu/NSE/mynse/graduate-advising)
  * [The Graduate School's current students resources page](https://gradschool.oregonstate.edu/current-students)


## Communication

We communicate primarily through Slack ([Download the desktop application here](https://slack.com/downloads/)). Once TP has added you to the RTRP slack page, check out the group's available channels: in the left sidebar of the desktop app, click Channels > Manage > Browse channels.
