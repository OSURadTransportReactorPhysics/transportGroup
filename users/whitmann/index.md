I am a fourth year Ph.D. student at Oregon State University under the direction of Dr. Todd Palmer in the Radiation Transport and Reactor Physics (RTRP) research group. I received my B.S. in Nuclear Engineering from Texas A&M University in May, 2016.

My current research involves solving the radiative transport equation for phonons to predict thermal conductivity in ceramics. My previous work and research could be summarized as: neutronic modeling of small special purpose nuclear power systems, dosimetry activation predictions inside research reactors, and modeling and analysis of sodium fast reactor shielding experiments.

## Research
* Lithium Aluminate is a ceramic breeder material that is of interest in the fusion community. Lithium Aluminate drastically changes microstructure and porosity as a function of neutron irradiation. These parameters directly impact the thermal performance properties of the ceramic. Certainty in thermal performance parameters is necessary for accurate and reliable modeling. The current fuel performance tools used by PNNL do not agree well with experimental data.

* Due to phonon transport being the primary heat transport mechanism in ceramic materials, Oregon State University and PNNL have partnered to develop a higher-fidelity mechanistic model based on phonon transport to approximate the thermal conductivity tensor in irradiated Lithium Aluminate. This model will eventually depend on the material microstructure, vacancy densities, defects and various other parameters that highly impact heat transport at the macro to micro-scale.

* We have developed an arbitrarily higher-order finite element radiation transport solver compatible with curved surfaces utilizing MFEM. This transport solver employs the Self-Adjoint Angular Flux (SAAF) formulation of the radiative transport equation using the Discrete Ordinates (Sn) approximation.

* Preliminary results simulating temperature profiles in silicon and lithium aluminate match previously published work

* Thermal conductivity profiles also show depression at the boundary as expected and match kinetic theory in the interior of the domain where application of diffuse treatment is expected

  * **XCP-3: Monte Carlo Methods, Codes, and Applications**, Mentors: Travis Trahan (XCP-3) and Jesson Hutchinson (NEN-2), *June - September 2020*
    * Verification and validation of the Subcritical Reflected alpha-Plutonium (SCRaP) experiments performed at NCERC using the Monte Carlo Application ToolKit (MCATK) software. The SCRaP experiments involved sixteen configurations of an alpha-phase, weapons-grade Plutonium sphere surrounded by varying layers of copper and polyethylene reflectors and two helium-3 multiplicity counters. Analysis included comparisons of MCATK to MCNP and measured values of multiplication factor, multiplication, count rates, and other counting parameters such as Feynman variance-to-mean.
