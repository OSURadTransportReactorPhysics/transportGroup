# Guides #

This page is an index of the growing set of guides behind the operations of the research group. It is intended to be a living document capturing the overviews and checklists for mastering the practical, administrative, and computational infrastructure that ARFC relies on for various common tasks. All research group members should contribute to this section early and often. If possible, link to GitHub repositories, gists, or Jupyter notebooks when there is a guide item that can be captured in one.
