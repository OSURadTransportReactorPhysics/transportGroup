# Current and Previous

I am very excited to be a first year graduate student working in the Radiation Transport and Reactor Physics research group. My research is undetermined at the moment.

Previously, I received my bachelor's degrees in physics and mathematics from Oregon State University. As a graduation requirement, I worked to complete a research project with Dr. Corinne Manogue and Dr. Tevian Dray. In this research, I proposed a grand unified theory for the standard model of particle physics that allows for Lorentz transformations. This unified theory utilized group theory, as well as quaternion and split complex number systems.
